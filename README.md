# restCountryApi

Introduction
Your job is to create a frontend page composed of UI elements containing the result of your
API endpoint. The project is to be implemented using JavaScript and the front-end cant be
done using a front-end of your choice preferably TailwindCSS or vanilla CSS or SCSS/Sass.
You may choose one of the following API endpoints to implement the project:
1) Rest countries API: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all
This api gives information about countries and a single country information object or
response can be found at https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v2-response-example
Should you choose to implement this API, the following should happen:
- The page should contain a list of countries (you can limit these to a certain number
per page if you want)
- For each country the following information should be displayed on your widget:
name, capital city, region, continent, population, currency name and symbol, main
language and flag.
- Implement filter, to filter countries for a given region for example.
- Implement a search box to only search information about one county (this is for
bonus points).
- Go through the API and read its implementation and come up with additional features
you could implement (this is for bonus points)
Below is a sample UI that could give you insight but feel free to implement a UI of your liking,
you can add icons or any other elements you wish.
